## CSS Animations

CSS allows animation of HTML elements without using JavaScript or Flash. An animation lets an element gradually change from one style to another.
You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.

## Set up for today:

### CodeSandBox:

We regularly use codesandbox.io for our challenges, an online editor that can be used to create and deploy web applications. If you prefer, you can use your own text editor eg Atom / Sublime / VS code.
You can sign in to codesandbox.io using a GitHub account. If you do not currently have one, you can create one here: Create a GitHub account
When you are logged in, create a new static Sandbox. https://codesandbox.io/s/github/codesandbox-app/static-template



## Make something using CSS animations:

### Option 1 

Bouncing ball: 
This is a guide to making a simple bouncing ball that you can follow along. You will need an HTML and CSS file either in codesandbox or your own text editor: https://codeburst.io/tutorial-make-a-bouncing-ball-entirely-with-css-1e7e3c853a50
